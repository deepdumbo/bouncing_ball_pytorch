# bouncing_ball_pytorch


Implementation of bouncing ball example in pytorch. Main idea is to use ConvLSTMs to capture SpatioTemporal information. For more information, have a look at the following paper [Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214v2.pdf). The code has been mostly insprired from [Convolutional-LSTM-in-Tensorflow](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Convolutional-LSTM-in-Tensorflow).
